## Product Spec
### User Stories:

List Projects
User Story: As a creative, I want to list my current projects (title, description, timeline) so others can join or follow.

Why: Makes it possible for users to post opportunities and for others to find projects to join, enabling team building.

Browse/Search Other Creatives
User Story: As a user, I want to browse other creativesâ€™ profiles to find collaborators or inspiration. (Use keywords to search quicker and filter stuff out)
Filter creatives by role and location, experience.

Why: Core to the appâ€™s valueâ€”users must be able to discover others to build teams and projects.

Express Interest/Bookmark
User Story: As a user, I want to bookmark profiles or projects so I can revisit them later and show my interest in collaborating. 

Nice to have: add a notification feature so that the user can be updated on their bookmarks or who liked their post (like instagram)

Why: Facilitates connection and team formation by allowing users to signal interest and keep track of potential collaborators or projects.

**Why These 3?**

They cover the full user journey: discovery, opportunity creation, and connection.
They are feasible: Each is achievable within a 2-week sprint for a small team.
They deliver the core value: Without these, the app cannot fulfill its business thesis of helping video work freelancers find and connect with each other for projects.
